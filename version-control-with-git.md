# Outline

Collaboration requires version control.

Version control is adequate for projects that involve programming and coding, and for projects that only involve text - for example writing documentation or a scientific paper.

All our documentation should be on a github repository for version control.

The presentation of the documentation should be in a pleasant and easily readable format for a human, such as [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). An example is the [Introduction to version control with Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) from [Code Refinery](https://coderefinery.org).
